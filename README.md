# robotiq2F_tcp
Python package to control Robotiq2F grippers over a number of physical interfaces:

- by connecting the RS-485 on a UR robot and wrapping the TCP API defined by the robotiq URCap
- by connecting the RS-485 to a usb connector over modbus RTU (TODO)



To use this controller, install the python package using `pip install git+https:`.
To extend, clone this repo and run pip install -e .
